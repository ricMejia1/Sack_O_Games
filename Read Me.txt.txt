In order to use the Sack O' Games, you will need to run the Sack O Games.py file in your IDE of choice,
the Sack O' Games appears to have trouble being displayed in CMD. So maybe don't run it there. 

You will need the following modules to play the games in the Sack O' Games:

- time
- random
- math
- tkinter
- keyboard

Without installing all we cannot guarantee that any of these games will run. 

Also, do not move any files out of this folder that you didn't put in. This can make it so that games will not run. 

All instructions for playing each game are displayed when you play them.

Enjoy!
